! - tilt coefficients are in arc-seconds

! The tilt coefficients should be zero so that scale changes never tilt the mirror
! and mess up pointing. If you measure a new tilt for collimation then run
! [TCC.RELEASE.SRC.SUBR.MIR.TEST]dooneorient2mount
! to determine the corresponding mount position for M1 actuators A, B, C.
! Then round those values to the nearest multiple of 50
! and use the rounded values to replace the first three values of PrimMountOffset tdat:mir.dat.
